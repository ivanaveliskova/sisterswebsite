			<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			In 1968, Pope Paul VI warned us of the dangers of abortion in his 
			encyclical letter, <i>Humanae Vitae</i>.&nbsp; Responsible 
			parenthood requires that all parents recognize their duties toward 
			God, themselves, their families and human society.&nbsp; No one has 
			the right to choose whether life will be transmitted in the marital 
			act or permitted to grow in the womb afterwards.&nbsp; </font>
			</p>
			<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			The Pope further warned us of the effects of artificial birth 
			control, including abortion.&nbsp; It could easily open wide the way 
			for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards. It 
			also leads to the reduction of a woman’s dignity to a mere 
			instrument for the satisfaction of a man’s desires, as he may no 
			longer consider her as his partner whom he should surround with care 
			and affection. &nbsp;Further, public authorities may choose to favor 
			certain contraceptive methods or even impose their use on everyone.&nbsp; 
			For the full text of <i>Humanae Vitae</i>, go to </font>
			<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html">

			http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html</font></a></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			On January 22 1973, the Supreme Court legalized abortion in the 
			well-known case of <u>
			Roe v. Wade</u>.&nbsp; Since then almost 50 million babies have been 
			denied the opportunity to be born, according to the National Right 
			to Life Committee.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			It is easy to see that Pope Paul VI’s fears about the effects of 
			abortion have come true.&nbsp; We no longer see wholesome images on 
			television, but rather graphic depictions of sexual oriented 
			activity, violence, and greed.&nbsp; We hear sexually explicit and 
			violent songs on the radio.&nbsp; Some people speak of their first 
			marriage as being the “special one” while others do not see a reason 
			to marry their significant other at all.&nbsp; Thirty-seven years 
			ago, infidelity was considered to be scandalous, while today it is 
			often merely a topic for gossip with no real sense of scandal.&nbsp; 
			Thirty-seven years ago, when a woman became pregnant outside of 
			marriage, the man was expected to “make her an honest woman” through 
			marriage, or at least support the child.&nbsp; Now, he may give her 
			money to have an abortion and make the unwanted child go away.&nbsp; 
			We have entered into a world where it is not unheard of for some men 
			to insist on DNA testing before they will accept the consequences of 
			an encounter that led to the birth of a child.&nbsp; In short, for 
			both men and women, misuse of our sexuality has come to be 
			considered normal.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Likewise, we have seen a decline in morals, generally speaking.&nbsp; 
			How often have we heard adults speak of the things our children do 
			today as being something they would not have “gotten away with”?&nbsp; 
			Who would have expected 37 years ago, that young children learn 
			vulgar language and routinely use it even when addressing their own 
			parents?&nbsp; Who would have thought that people in the United 
			States would be considered “odd” for acting on their traditional 
			Judeo-Christian values?</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Together we can work to prevent the further loss of innocent life.&nbsp; 
			We offer three suggestions of ways you can voice your opposition to 
			abortion.&nbsp; First, members of the Sisters of St. John the 
			Baptist and students from our own St. John Villa Academy High School 
			went to Washington, D.C. on the 37<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the <u>
			Roe v. Wade</u> decision on January 22 to participate in a march and 
			voice the opposition to the culture of death which has resulted.&nbsp; 
			We urge all who are able to join us and thousands of other people 
			who are committed to the pro-life movement and make our position 
			known once again next year.&nbsp;
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			The second way to voice your opposition to abortion is to write to 
			your Senators and Congressman by going to the website
			<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.contactingthecongress.org/">
			http://www.contactingthecongress.org/</a>&nbsp; The erosion of the 
			right to life looms especially large this year as our legislature 
			considers health care reform, which may result in subsidized 
			abortions and further oppress our Catholic belief in the unborn 
			child’s right to life.&nbsp; Perhaps we can persuade our legislators 
			not to enact any laws that allow taxpayer monies to be used to fund 
			abortions.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Our third suggestion to fight the evils of abortion is to pray, 
			pray, and pray some more.&nbsp; Words are not enough to describe the 
			power of prayer.&nbsp; God can work on the hearts of the lawmakers, 
			doctors, and nurses who support abortion.&nbsp; God can bring 
			healing to the mothers who have had abortions and their family 
			members who have been affected by it.&nbsp; God welcomes the babies 
			into their heavenly home where they will never be turned away again.&nbsp; 
			God alone can and does work these miracles.&nbsp; We have only but 
			to ask Him and contribute our best efforts.&nbsp; After all, if we 
			pray like it all depends on God and act like it all depends on God, 
			we really can’t go wrong.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			May God bless all victims of abortion, living and deceased, and may 
			God bless you in all your efforts.</font></div>

      <p ALIGN="left" style="margin-bottom: o"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was 1955 and
      my religious Superiors had asked me&nbsp; to leave my parish work in Bronx, NY to
      help our Brazilian community prepare young girls for religious life.&nbsp;
      After what seemed like an endless trip from the United States I finally
      arrived in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.&nbsp; Little did I know then that this
      beautiful country with its warm and wonderful people would become my new
      home for the next 26 years</font></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: o"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my delight I found Belo Horizonte, the capital of the state of Minas Gerais, to be a beautiful city. To my sadness I found that many poor
      people existed here, living in the direst of poverty. And not only here, but
      throughout Brazil.</font><img border="0" src="../baptistines/favela_2.gif" align="right" hspace="10" alt="A typical &quot;favela&quot; in Brazil." width="214" height="294"></b></p>

      soon learned that many families from the northern part of Brazil migrate
      to Belo&nbsp; Horizonte because it is a big city and they hope to find
      work and be able to support their families. However, since they are
      strangers with little or no marketable skills, few find any work and most
      have to resort to begging on the streets. As they struggle to provide
      shelter for their families, they consider themselves fortunate to find
      pieces of cardboard, paper or tin that can be cobbled together as a
      temporary hut. As hut after hut springs up, a city
      within a city, the &quot;favelas&quot; emerges. Nearly all lack basic city
      services most of us take for granted: running water, underground sewerage,
      paved streets, electric street lighting, trash collection and mail
      service.<br>
